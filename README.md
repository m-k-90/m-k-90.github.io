## Building Data Products Coursera Project (leaflets)

This project is done as part of Building Data Products course conducted by John Hopkins University through Coursera. This is done as part of Week2 lesson (R Markdown and Leaflet)

### Instructions

Create a web page using R Markdown that features a map created with Leaflet.

Host your webpage on either GitHub Pages, RPubs, or NeoCities.

Your webpage must contain the date that you created the document, and it must contain a map created with Leaflet. We would love to see you show off your creativity!
